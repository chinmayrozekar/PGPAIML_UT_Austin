Rapid heart rate - The individual's heart may beat faster than normal to try and compensate for the reduced blood flow to the lungs.\\n4. Rapid breathing - The body may respond to the lack of oxygen by increasing the breathing rate.\\n5. Coughing up blood or blood-streaked sputum - This is less common but can be a sign of a more severe pulmonary embolism.\\n6.

The response also acknowledges the importance of maintaining proper immobilization to protect the spinal cord and blood vessels and relieving pain with a short-acting opioid. Additionally, the response discusses the role of plasticity in recovery from brain injury and the importance of clinical diagnosis through neuropsychologic testing, laboratory tests, and brain imaging.
